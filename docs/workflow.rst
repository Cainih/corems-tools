Typical Workflow
================

Here, we outline a typical workflow for using CoreMS and CoreMSTools to process CoreMS assignments of large, multi-sample LC-MS datasets. The overall goal of the workflow is to generate a feature list. A feature list is a list of assignments that are least likely to be erroneous and, importantly, it includes the abundance of these assignments in each sample in the dataset. In addition to including molecular formulas and the intensities, feature lists also typically include - at a minimum - the measured m/z, assignment error, and retention time of each ion.

The steps of a typical workflow can be divided into three groupings. 
    1. Formula assignments 
    2. Quality control checks
    3. Feature filtering 


Formula assignments 
-------------------

CoreMSTools only works with assignments generated by CoreMS. If you are new to using CoreMS for formula assignments of LC-MS data, check out the CoreMS Primer section. 

After CoreMS assignments are complete, they can be loaded into an `Assignments` object. To do this, a dataframe containing a column with the name of each raw file in the dataset is required. We also need to define the directory in which the assignment results are located. 

.. code-block::

    from coremstools.Parameters import Settings

    Settings.assignments_directory = "/Volumes/IQX-Data/"

    flist = []
    for f in os.listdir(Settings.raw_file_directory):
        if '.raw' in f:
            flist.append(f)

    df = pd.DataFrame({'File':flist})

Now we can make an `Assignments` object:

.. code-block::

    assignments = Assignments(sample_df=df)


Quality control checks
----------------------

With this assignments object, we can run quality control checks on our internals standard.

.. code-block::

    assignments.run_internal_std_qc([10,12])
