CoreMSTools is a Python package for processing and curating molecular formula assignments generated by `CoreMS <https://github.com/EMSL-Computing/CoreMS>`_. This toolset is intended to be used with LC-MS data collected on ultrahigh resolution instruments (FT-ICR-MS, Orbitrap-MS). **The primary aim of this project is to reduce the number of erroneous assignments in an LC-MS dataset.** 

.. note::

    The ability to generate formulas assignments with CoreMS is a prerequisite for use of this package. 
    
    CoreMS is a comprehensive software framework for the analysis of small molecules measured by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. It is developed and maintained by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a US Department of Energy facility. The primary developers of CoreMS are Yuri Corilo and Will Kew.

Instrument Compatibility
------------------------

This package is currently only compatible with raw data files generated by Thermo instrument software (i.e., `.raw` files). In theory, the package could easily be adapted for data collected on non-Thermo instruments with non-Thermo software, however we currently do not have plans to do this. 

.. note::

    CoreMS is not limited to Thermo data inputs and is compatible with many file types.

System Compatibility
--------------------

We recommend installing and running CoreMS and CoreMSTools on an x86_64 system. Unix platforms are preferred, but Windows also works. CoreMSTools will run on arm64 systems (i.e., the new Macs), but installing and running CoreMS on these systems can be challenging.
