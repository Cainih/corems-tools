Assignments h5 file:
    - instead of saving assignments of each sample as .csv, save as group in .h5 for dataset

Assignments class:
## OPERATES ON SINGLE SAMPLE IN DATASET
    - holds raw assignments for a sample
    - how raw assignments can be imported:
        * as .csv; one .csv per sample
        * as .h5; one .h5 per sample OR one h5 group within one h5 file containing assignments of dataset  
    - methods that can operate on assignments of a sample:
        * internal standard qc check 
        * assignment error plots 
        * molecular class v. retention
        * dispersity calculation 
        * export as .csv (if incoming format if .h5)

FeatureList class:
## OPERATES ON ALL SAMPLES IN DATASET
    - holds the feature list for an entire dataset 
    - construction of feature list:
        * build from assignments of each sample in dataset 
            ~ loop thru samples (how depends on file type of sample assignments / dataset)
        * need to avoid loading all sample assignments into memory
            ~ use .h5 and only load needed data?
            ~ dask?
            ~ write feature list to group in dataset .h5?
    - methods that can operate on feature list:
        * dispersity calculation 
            ~ for eic extraction, save each eic in .h5 
        * feature alignment
        * gapfilling 
        * blank feature filtering
        * export as .csv
